# Simple-Feature-Merge

##Shyam Pandya, Ari Stassinopoulos, Manas Taneja, and Jeffrey Tian

Our repository is an example of the Feature Branch and Merge Request format. We created a `code.txt` file to show how this can easily work with merge conflicts. After creating that file, we each created a branch with our last name and our first initial. We edited separate sections of the code.txt file and then merged to master using pull requests. The pull request interface is much easier to manage and review than manually resolving merge conflicts and this workflow avoids the complexity of the Github flow and Gitlab flow.
